Overview

For certain key functions, algstat makes back-end connections to
outside programs to get the job done.  The programs come in bundles of
varying sizes and complexities.  Thus, by the "program" we could
either mean a program bundle that contains several executables, or a
single bundle itself.  The bundles themselves, along with where they
can be obtained, are: 

1. LattE integrale :
https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software.php, note that this
distribution contains the 4ti2 bundle.  

2. Bertini : https://bertini.nd.edu 

3. Macaulay2 : http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/ Notes on how to
install each of these are listed below.  As always, you should see
the installation instructions of the individual packages before
proceeding.

As a rundown of which functions depend on which packages, see the
following list.  Note that the list is not meant to be all-inclusive
since a number of functions can function with or without the packages.

Bertini - bertini, polyOptim, polySolve, projectOnto, variety

LattE integrale/4ti2 - count, countTables, hierarchical, latteMax,
latteMin

4ti2 - markov, spectral, groebner, zbasis

Macaulay2 - m2













On Windows


Step 1: Cygwin part.

• Go to Cygwin website.  
• Click Install Cygwin on the left nav bar.
• Click setup-x86.exe and Install from Internet.  
• When the "Select Roots Install Directory" page appears, click
next. (C:\cygwin64 is assumed for this writeup.)
• Click next through until you get to the "Choose A Download Site"
page.
• Select any mirror (e.g. http://mirrors.kernel.org).  
• In the Select Packages screen, 
	* Click the icon to the right of Devel to change it from
	  "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the icon to the right of Interpreters to change it
	  from "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the icon to the right of Math to change it from
	  "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the + icon to the left of R to expand it and click
	  twice on "3.1.0-1" (or whatever the version is) to change it
	  to "Skip".  
• Click next through everything to complete the download, and then
install it; this last part takes a while so be ready to wait.
• Once you've installed Cygwin, open it from the start menu.


Step 2: Unzip LattE.

• Go to https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software.php.  
• Click LattE integrale 1.7.2 bundle to download (save it).  
• Move the downloaded file (latte-integrale-1.7.2.tar.gz) into your
Cygwin home directory, for example, from
C:\Users\david_kahle\Downloads to C:\cygwin64\home\david_kahle\ 
(Note that if you didn't open Cygwin, the user directory
(\David_Kahle\) won't be there.)


Step 3: In Cygwin.

• Open Cygwin and type "pwd" and enter, the directory listed above
should come up. (Now as /home/david_kahle, for example.) 
• Type "ls" and enter, you should see the
latte-integrale-1.7.2.tar.gz that you put in from before.

• Type tar -xf latte-integrale-1.7.2.tar.gz 
• Type mv latte-integrale-1.7.2 latte (this renames the directory) 
• Type cd latte 
• Type ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --disable-lidia 
• Type make (this takes a very long time to work, so be ready to
wait)
(• Type make install) 
• Type ls -al bin, you should see a relatively long list of stuff
that includes count.exe (this is part of LattE) and markov.exe (this
is part of 4ti2).  If not, something went wrong.

The executables are then made in the directory $HOME/latte/bin


Step 4: Set the system path to include the new executables.

• Edit the system path by the following:
	* Right click the My Computer icon on the desktop.  Click
	  "Advanced system settings" on the left nav bar, and then
	  click Environment Variables under the Advanced tab (the
	  window should be labeled System Properties).
	* Under System variables, click Path, then Edit...
	* To the beginning of the path string, add
	  "C:\cygwin64\bin;C:\cygwin64\home\david_kahle\latte\bin;"
	* Click Ok, Ok, and Ok, to get rid of all the windows.      


Step 5: Inside R.

• If you have R already, skip to the next step; if not, go to
http://cran.r-project.org/, click Download R for Windows, and click
next through everything to install it.  
• Open R (the x64 version), and inside R type
install.packages("algstat") at the prompt and enter.
• Type library(algstat), you should see 
  Loading required package:
  mpoly please cite mpoly if you use it.
  type citation("mpoly") for details how.
  Macaulay2 not found.  Set the location with setM2Path(). 
  Bertini not found.  Set the location with setBertiniPath().  
• If you see the following, but saw the .exe files above, do the
following:
	* 4ti2 not found.  Set the location with set4ti2Path()
		- Type set4ti2Path() and navigate to where you created
		  4ti2.  This is usually
		  C:\cygwin64\home\David_Kahle\latte\bin (you would go
		  to that +\markov, and click ok), but algstat checks
		  there by default.
	* Latte not found.  Set the location with setLattePath()
		- Same as above with setLattePath(); navigate to where
		  you stored count.exe and click ok.  
• To check that the 4ti2 connection is made, type ?markov and run
the first few examples; i.e.
  varlvls <- c(2,2)
  facets <- list(1,2)
  ( A <- hmat(varlvls, facets) )
  markov(A) 
You shouldn't get any errors.  
• To check that the LattE connection is made, type 
  ?count
and run the first few examples there; namely 
  spec <- c("x + y <= 10", "x >= 1", "y >= 1")
  count(spec)
You shouldn't get any errors.

















On OS-X


Step 1: Get your compilers and so forth ready; download and unzip
LattE.

• Open Xcode, then go to Xcode > Preferences... under the Downloads
tab, click the down arrow next to Command Line Tools to download them
onto your computer.  After its done, close Xcode.  
• Download LattE integrale 1.7.3 bundle (latte-integrale-1.7.3.tar.gz) 
• Open Terminal.app and type "echo $HOME". This is your home directory on
your machine.  
• In Finder, double click the downloaded
latte-integrale-1.7.3.tar.gz to unzip it and move the unzipped
folder into your home directory.  Change the unzipped directory's
name from "latte-integrale-1.7.3” to simply "latte".  (In what
follows, you can also use "/Applications" in place of "$HOME", if
you want to install it into your Applications directory.) 
• Open Terminal.app and type cd $HOME/latte


Step 2: Install everything.

• Type ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --disable-lidia 
• Type make (this takes a very long time to work, so be ready to wait) 
(• Type make install) 
• Type ls -al bin, you should see a relatively long list
of stuff that includes count (this is part of LattE) and markov (this
is part of 4ti2).  If not, something went wrong.


Step 3: Inside R.

• Go to Step 5: Inside R. under the Windows header.
